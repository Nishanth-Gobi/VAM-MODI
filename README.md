# Transporation Problem

## Description

This project is an implemetation of the research paper 
[A Heuristic on Risk Management System in Goods Transportation Model Using Multi-Optimality by MODI Method](https://github.com/Nishanth-Gobi/scl-package/blob/main/A_Heuristic_on_Risk_Management_System_in_Goods_Tra.pdf)

- Basic feasible solution is found using the **Vogel Approximation Method (VAM)**

- Optimal solution is foundusing the **Modified Distribution Method (MODI)**

## Future work

The path finding function (under MODI) needs to be improved to find closed-paths that have more than four vertices (as needed by test case 4).
